I liked this plot, partially because I recently moved from Chicago myself, took the CTA every day (Blue Line!), and nearly used CTA data as the basis for my own HW8 plot. It's interesting to consider how many different stories you can tell with the same data set.

Student used Python/Matplotlib, and the line chart is nicely set - colors and lines are crisp, the grid is appropriatly light, the legend is placed well, the y-axis scale is nicely handled, and the proportions are perfect.

# color are non color-blind safe 

A few points I might adjust - using either a difference in alpha or line thickness to distinguish the train/bus lines from the total line, plotting the data field by month-year rather than just year (especially to see if the rail and bus converged so far this year), and adding minor ticks for each year.

Two other features that increase the effectiveness of the plot: the caption is helpful and descriptive, and the data has a clear "so what" (that the ridership has decreased while the ratio of train to bus rides is higher than ever).

# FBB 

still missing the clarity/aesthetic/honesty points: the plot lacks clarity to people with altered color perception (1/10 people!) . YOur comments on the lack of ticks fall into the clarity domain as well

aesthetically: your comments on the line width etc are valid

honesty: the y axis is truncated making the change appear more significant than they are. To overcome this issue one could plot error bars (statistical error bars = sqrt(counts)) or alternatively, if the plot is actually only conveyed to show that there was a decrease followed by a rise that is of comparable magnitude then it is ok.
