For assignment 3, worked in the CUSP offices, 19th floor, on Wednesday evening with students there. Namely Kent Pan and Matt Sauter.

Derived For loop myself and shared structure with other group members. Initially plotted using a different For loop. Discussed with Kent and used his method instead. Worked with Matt Sauter to understand array structure and apply random coloring. Used scatter method rather than plot in the end, so random color generation was not incorporated into the final product.

Created and ran .ipynb file successfully in homedirs. Imported here - Github is reflecting issues displaying the notebook.
