**CLARITY**

The plot is very clear and easy to read. It successfully combined quite a lot of useful information about the rent change in 30 neighborhoods in New York City from November 2011 to September 2017 in one plot.

In the plot, five colors are chosen to represent five boroughs which should be included in the legend of the plot. Another suggestion is to add x axis label for each plot, which will make it easier when reading the plot by lines. 

**AESTHETIC**

The color of the plot is well chosen. Very good job in the layout of the subplots.The y axis scales are set to be the same range which makes it very easy to compare between different neighborhoods. The background grids are useful when comparing the values. Colors are easy to distinguish. Overall very good job considering aesthetics.

**HONESTY**

The plot honestly reports the dataset chosen. There is no distortion of the data. It would be useful if some information is provided about the reason for choosing this 30 neighborhoods to study. Now, most neighborhoods are in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The five neighborhoods of other three boroughs are in the last line which represent lowest rent price, which will give an impression that these three boroughs have lower rent compare to the other two. I am not sure if this is really the case. But it will be helpful to provide some information about the rent level in different boroughs or category the subplots by boroughs.
